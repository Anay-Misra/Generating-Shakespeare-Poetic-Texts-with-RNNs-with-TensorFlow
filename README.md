## Overview
This project involves training a neural network to generate text that mimics the style of Shakespeare. The model learns to predict the next character in a sequence, allowing it to generate new text one character at a time.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a collection of Shakespeare's works, which is available at the following URL:
[Shakespeare Text](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt)

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
